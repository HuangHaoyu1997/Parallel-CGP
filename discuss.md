In summary, we have proposed YOMO, an ABM framework enabling automatic regulation of social models by using a hypergraph to construct the complex dependency of components and a control protocol to unify various regulations into three basic graph operations. We further establish a social model about international oil trading and utilize the heuristic and learning methods proposed to carry out the evaluation, problem prescription and the policy enhancement of this model. Experiments show the feasibility of our framework by emerging new mechanisms and social behaviors under the certain guidance. Future works will focus on the development of more social scenarios to extend the generality and optimize the conversion process from raw program architecture to the hypergraph structure. Notably, the structure of hypergraph and protocol is a universal description of agent-based modeling and regulating, which has not only access to social agent model research but different areas as biology, military and engineering simulation. We expect this work could accelerate the complex agent-based modeling and relax human efforts more than social scenario by executing this automated regulating pipeline.
